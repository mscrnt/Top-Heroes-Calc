    <h1>Best Gear & Stats for Barbarian</h1>
    <p>Building Barbarian in <strong>Top Heroes</strong> requires the ideal gear – and there are some things to keep in mind. This guide provides multiple setups that will work for early-game players or end-game veterans in <strong>Top Heroes</strong>.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Starter Gear</h2>
        <p>This loadout is the baseline since you want to make the full <strong>Guardian of Terra</strong> Set Bonus. You can level these pieces up as the set bonus does not work with different rarities. Once you get a yellow gear item and equip it, the set bonus will stop working! Collect all items before switching, as it takes time. Ensure the sub-stats are optimal (more on that below).</p>

        <h2>Advanced Gear Build</h2>
        <p>To keep the full <strong>Guardian of Terra</strong> Set Bonus, you need to collect all gear items below before equipping them!</p>
        <div class="gear-grid">
            <img src="/static/images/gear/topheroes-terran-heavy-axe.png" alt="Terran Heavy Axe">
            <img src="/static/images/gear/topheroes-terran-heavy-armor.png" alt="Terran Heavy Armor">
            <img src="/static/images/gear/topheroes-terran-heavy-helmet.png" alt="Terran Heavy Helmet">

    <section>
        <h2>Final Gear Build</h2>
        <p>To keep the full <strong>Thunder's Protection</strong> Set Bonus, collect all items below before equipping them. The set bonuses are unique, so replacing single items will remove the <strong>FULL</strong> set bonus!</p>
        <div class="gear-grid">
            <img src="/static/images/gear/topheroes-thunder-hammer.png" alt="Thunder Hammer">

            <img src="/static/images/gear/topheroes-thunder-boots.png" alt="Thunder Boots">
            <img src="/static/images/gear/topheroes-thunder-helmet.png" alt="Thunder Helmet">

        <h2>Best Stats on Your Gear</h2>
        <p>The gear items provide set bonuses, but you also need the correct stats to make them worth leveling. If the stats are wrong, <strong>DO NOT LEVEL</strong> the gear item. It’s a waste of time and resources, and will set you back significantly. Here are the stats you want:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><img src="/static/images/topheroes-hp.png" alt="HP Icon" class="stat-icon"> <strong>HP:</strong> Absolutely mandatory. Do not touch a gear item without it! It is essential for Barbarian's role and kit and must be on all four gear items.</li>
        </ul>
