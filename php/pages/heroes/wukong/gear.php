    <h1>Best Gear & Stats for WuKong</h1>
    <p>Building WuKong in <strong>Top Heroes</strong> requires the ideal gear – and there are some things to keep in mind. This guide provides multiple setups that will work for early-game players or end-game veterans in <strong>Top Heroes</strong>.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Starter Gear</h2>
        <p>This loadout is the baseline since you want to make the full <strong>Wisdom of Sage</strong> Set Bonus. You can level these pieces up as the set bonus does not work with different rarities. Once you get a yellow gear item and equip it, the set bonus will stop working! Collect all items before switching, as it takes time. Ensure the sub-stats are optimal (more on that below).</p>

        <h2>Advanced Gear Build</h2>
        <p>To keep the full <strong>Wisdom of Sage</strong> Set Bonus, you need to collect all gear items below before equipping them!</p>
        <div class="gear-grid">
            <img src="/static/images/gear/topheroes-sage-staff.png" alt="Sage Staff">

    <section>
        <h2>Final Gear Build</h2>
        <p>To keep the full <strong>Fury of the Sun</strong> Set Bonus, you need to collect all gear items below before equipping them! Only replacing single gear items will remove the FULL set bonus.</p>

        <h2>Best Stats on Your Gear</h2>
        <p>The gear items provide set bonuses, but you also need the correct stats to make them worth leveling. If the stats are wrong, <strong>DO NOT LEVEL</strong> the gear item. It’s a waste of time and resources and will set you back significantly. Here are the stats you want:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><img src="/static/images/topheroes-attack.png" alt="Attack Icon" class="stat-icon"> <strong>Attack:</strong> Absolutely mandatory. Do not even touch a gear item without it! It's essential for WuKong's role and kit and must be on all four gear items.</li>
        </ul>
