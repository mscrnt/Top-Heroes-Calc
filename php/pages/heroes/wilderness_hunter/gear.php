    <h1>Best Gear & Stats for Wilderness Hunter</h1>
    <p>Building Wilderness Hunter in <strong>Top Heroes</strong> requires the ideal gear – and there are some things to mind. In this guide, you will find multiple setups that will work, for early-game players or end-game veterans in <strong>Top Heroes</strong>.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Starter Gear</h2>
        <p>This loadout is the baseline since you want to make the full <strong>Wisdom of Sage</strong> Set Bonus. You can level the pieces up as the set bonus does not work with different rarities. Once you get a yellow gear item and equip it, the set bonus will stop working! Collect all items before switching. Make sure the sub-stats work well (more on that below).</p>

            <img src="/static/images/gear/topheroes-cavalry-boots.png" alt="Cavalry Boots">
            <img src="/static/images/gear/topheroes-cavalry-helmet.png" alt="Cavalry Helmet">
        </div>
        <p><strong>Recommended Pieces:</strong> Knight's Longsword, Cavalry Armor, Cavalry Boots, and Cavalry Helmet.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Advanced Gear Build</h2>
        <p>To keep the full <strong>Wisdom of Sage</strong> Set Bonus, you need to collect all gear items below before equipping them!</p>
        <div class="gear-grid">
            <img src="/static/images/gear/topheroes-sage-staff.png" alt="Sage Staff">
            <img src="/static/images/gear/topheroes-sage-robe.png" alt="Sage Robe">
            <img src="/static/images/gear/topheroes-sage-boots.png" alt="Sage Boots">
            <img src="/static/images/gear/topheroes-sage-hood.png" alt="Sage Hood">
        </div>
        <p><strong>Recommended Pieces:</strong> Sage Staff, Sage Robe, Sage Boots, and Sage Hood.</p>
        <p>Now, ideally, you want to look out for gear with the <strong>affinity tag</strong> to get a 30% stats bonus.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Final Gear Build</h2>
        <p>To keep the full <strong>Fury of the Sun</strong> Set Bonus, collect all items below before equipping them. The set bonuses are different, so replacing single items will remove the <strong>FULL</strong> set bonus!</p>
        <div class="gear-grid">
            <img src="/static/images/gear/topheroes-solar-blade.png" alt="Solar Blade">
            <img src="/static/images/gear/topheroes-solar-armor.png" alt="Solar Armor">
            <img src="/static/images/gear/topheroes-solar-boots.png" alt="Solar Boots">
            <img src="/static/images/gear/topheroes-solar-helmet.png" alt="Solar Helmet">
        </div>
        <p><strong>Recommended Pieces:</strong> Solar Blade, Solar Armor, Solar Boots, and Solar Helmet.</p>

        <h2>Best Stats on Your Gear</h2>
        <p>The gear items are only the beginning. They provide set bonuses, but you also need the correct stats to make them worth leveling. If the stats are wrong, <strong>DO NOT LEVEL</strong> the gear item. It’s a waste of time and resources and will set you back a lot. Here are the stats you want:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><img src="/static/images/topheroes-attack.png" alt="Attack Icon" class="stat-icon"> <strong>Attack:</strong> Absolutely mandatory. All four gear items must have this stat. Do not even touch a gear item without it!</li>
        </ul>
