    <h1>Best Gear & Stats for Pixie</h1>
    <p>Building Pixie in <strong>Top Heroes</strong> requires the ideal gear – and there are some things to keep in mind. This guide provides multiple setups that will work for early-game players or end-game veterans in <strong>Top Heroes</strong>.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Starter Gear</h2>
        <p>This loadout is the baseline since you want to make the full <strong>Wisdom of Sage</strong> Set Bonus. You can level these pieces up, but note that once you equip one yellow gear item from below, you may lose synergy. Collect all items before switching, as it takes time. Ensure the sub-stats are optimal (more on that below).</p>

        <h2>Final Gear Build</h2>
        <p>To keep the full <strong>Fury of the Sun</strong> Set Bonus, you need to collect all gear items below before equipping them. Only replacing single gear items will remove the FULL set bonus!</p>

        <h2>Best Stats on Your Gear</h2>
        <p>The gear items provide set bonuses, but you also need the correct stats to make them worth leveling. If the stats are wrong, <strong>DO NOT LEVEL</strong> the gear item. It’s a waste of time and resources and will set you back significantly. Here are the stats you want:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><img src="/static/images/topheroes-attack.png" alt="Attack Icon" class="stat-icon"> <strong>Attack:</strong> Absolutely mandatory. Do not even touch a gear item without it! It's essential for Pixie's role and kit and must be on all four gear items.</li>
        </ul>
